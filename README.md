## Description
For this application, we were tasked with creating a Portfolio page using React.js. This page includes a home page with a profile picture, an about me section, a contact me section with a form, a portfolio listing past works, and a resume.

## Installation
Install dependencies using ``` npm i ```. A list of the different script commands to use in the terminal can be seen in the ``` package.json ``` file. Use ``` npm run build ``` to build the application or simply ``` npm run start ``` to build and start the server all at once.
